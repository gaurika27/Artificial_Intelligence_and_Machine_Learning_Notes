Machine learning derives rules from the data itself. It uses a variety of data collected in the past to uncover patterns hidden in that data. The patterns are then used to create a model, which is applied to new data to provide a more well-informed and adaptive prediction. For instance, a programmer could build a model that collects data from each unique customer. Then based on the patterns the algorithm sees in the data, it can provide a unique recommendation for each user. When using machine learning, patterns are used to provide recommendations.
