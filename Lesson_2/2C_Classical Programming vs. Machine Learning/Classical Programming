In classical programming, humans create rules based on factors like business requirements and domain knowledge. For instance, a programmer could set rules that say, "if this customer purchased product X in the past, show them product Y." The reason for this suggestion would be because of some relationship between those two products. Using a classical programming approach requires programmers to explicitly define and set rules.
