A model in machine learning is the trained algorithm that you use to identify patterns in your data. A model is trained through the machine learning process and captures and stores patterns. The more patterns a model stores, the bigger it will become. Machine learning model sizes are typically described in megabytes. The purpose of a model is to predict outcomes to new data inputs, based on previously observed patterns.
