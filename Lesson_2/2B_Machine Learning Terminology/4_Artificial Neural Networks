An artificial neural network is a collection of connected units or nodes that are used to build an information model based on biological systems. Each node is called an artificial neuron and mimics a biological neuron. It receives an input (stimulus), becomes activated if the input signal is strong enough (activation), and produces an output predicated on the input and activation. Itâ€™s widely used in machine learning because an artificial neural network can serve as a general-purpose approximation to any function.
