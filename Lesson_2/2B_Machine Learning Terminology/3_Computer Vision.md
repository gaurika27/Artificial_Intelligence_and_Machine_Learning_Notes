With computer vision, machines can identify people, places, and things in images with accuracy at or above human levels with much greater speed and efficiency. Often built with deep learning models, it automates extraction, analysis, classification, and understanding of useful information from a single image or sequence of images. The image data can take many forms, such as single images, video sequences, views from multiple cameras, or three-dimensional data.
