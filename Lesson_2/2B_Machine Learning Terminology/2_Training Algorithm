In machine learning, you can use training algorithms to help you accomplish empirical tasks that require some sort of inductive inference. This objective involves induction because it uses data to train algorithms to make generalizable inferences. Thus, algorithms can make statistically reliable predictions or decisions, or complete other tasks, when they apply new data that was not used to train them. An algorithm-trained algorithm identifies patterns in your data without requiring any explicit, manually set rules.
