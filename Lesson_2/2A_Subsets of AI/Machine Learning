Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence where the computer program derives rules from the data itself. It uses a variety of data that was collected in the past to uncover patterns that are hidden in that data. The patterns are then used to create a model, which is applied to new data to provide a more well-informed and adaptive prediction.

Example: Machines that learn to play chess from previous games that were played
