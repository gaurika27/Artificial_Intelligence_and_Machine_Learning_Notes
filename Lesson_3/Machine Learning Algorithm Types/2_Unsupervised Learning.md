The model doesn't know inputs or outputs, so it finds patterns in the data without help. In unsupervised learning, labels are not providedâ€”you don't know all the variables and patterns. In these instances, the machine must uncover and create the labels itself. These models use the data that they're presented with to detect emerging properties of the entire dataset, and then construct patterns.

A common subcategory of unsupervised learning is called clustering. This kind of algorithm groups data into different clusters based on similar features to better understand the attributes of a specific cluster.

For example, by analyzing customer purchasing habits, an unsupervised learning algorithm can identify a company as being large or small.
