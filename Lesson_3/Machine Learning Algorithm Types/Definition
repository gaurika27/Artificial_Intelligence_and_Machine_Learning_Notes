Machine learning algorithms are sets of rules that are followed for problem-solving operations. They are trained through the machine learning process and applied to new data to provide a more well-informed and adaptive prediction. This ability to self-train is the power behind machine learning.

Machine learning algorithms fall into three categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
