The model uses known inputs and outputs to generalize future outputs. Supervised learning is a popular type of machine learning because it's widely applicable. It's called supervised learning because there must be a supervisor. Labeled training data is the supervisor.

For example, the model receives pictures of cars, which people have labeled as cars. Then, when the model receives a new picture of a car that is not labeled, the model can predict that it is a car.
