A machine learning engineer researches, design, and builds machine learning models. Machine learning engineers are responsible for:
- Designing machine learning systems
- Researching and implementing appropriate machine learning algorithms and tools
- Developing machine learning applications according to requirements
- Selecting appropriate datasets and data representation methods
- Running machine learning tests and experiments
- Performing statistical analysis and fine-tuning by using test results
- Training and retraining systems when necessary


If you decide to work toward a career as a machine learning engineer, you need some skills that are similar to a data scientistâ€™s skills. However, your focus is more on programming skills and software architecture. As a machine learning engineer, you can apply those skills to designing and developing machine learning systems. Machine learning engineers often have previous experience with software development. Although these roles also require technical competencies in statistics and machine learning, they rely more on programming and software engineering than other machine learning roles.
