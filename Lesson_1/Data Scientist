A data scientist analyzes and interprets complex digital data. Data scientists are responsible for:
• Collecting data by analyzing business results or by setting up new studies
• Transferring data into a new format to make it more appropriate for analysis
• Building tools to automate data collection
• Searching through large datasets for usable information
• Creating reports and presentations for business uses
• Correlating similar data to find actionable results


If you want to be a data scientist, you should focus on developing analytical, statistical, and programming skills. As a data scientist, you use those skills to collect, analyze, and interpret large datasets. Some universities now offer degrees in data science, but data scientists often have degrees in statistics, math, computer science, or economics. As a data scientist, you need technical competencies in statistics, machine learning, programming languages, and data analytics.
