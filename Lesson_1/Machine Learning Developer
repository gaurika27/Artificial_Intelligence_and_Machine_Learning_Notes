A machine learning developer is employed to research, design, and build machine learning models. Machine learning developers are responsible for:
• Implementing machine learning systems
• Researching and implementing appropriate machine learning algorithms and tools
• Developing machine learning applications according to requirements
• Selecting appropriate datasets and data representation methods
• Running machine learning tests and experiments
• Performing statistical analysis and fine-tuning by using test results
• Training and retraining systems when necessary


Many software developers are now integrating machine learning into their applications. If you are working toward a career as a software developer, you should include machine learning technology in your course of study. As a machine learning developer, you primarily focus on software development skills, but you also need some of the skills of a data scientist. Therefore, you should include coursework in statistics and applied mathematics.
