Applied scientists do scientific research with a focus on applying the results of their studies to solving real-world problems. Applied science researchers are responsible for:
  -   Using the scientific method to develop research questions
  -   Conducting studies that lead to practical solutions
  -   Applying machine learning skills to develop functional applications
  -   Using machine learning to improve business outcomes


You might also decide to work toward a career in science where you can apply machine learning technology. Machine learning has an impact on everything from astronomy to zoology, so many different paths are open to you. As an applied science researcher, you primarily focus on the type of science that you decide to concentrate on. You need some of the skills of a data scientist, but you must also know how to apply those skills to your chosen domain. These roles also require technical competencies in statistics and machine learning.
